# SDN-LG

Software-defined networking - Looking Glass aims to be a toolchain for SDN troubleshooting. It is designed to be modular, allowing new funcionalities to be easily added.
The main funcionalities here are:
- OpenFlow sniffer: OpenFlow message dissector, trying to be more complete than Wireshark implementation.
- SDNTrace: Tracepath for OpenFlow networks.
- Real-time statistics.
- Historical statistics.
